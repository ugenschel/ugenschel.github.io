      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics</p>
    </header>
    <p>I have been an Assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at
      Iowa State since Fall 2009. My research interests are Reliability, Robust
      Statistics and Statistics Education. I also serve as the Advisor to the Undergraduate
      Statistics Club. I enjoy teaching and like to get to know my students -
      so don’t be surprised if I know you by name. Teaching has always been a
      passion of mine and I care about every student’s success. I work hard to
      provide a positive learning experience in the classroom but I expect my
      students to work hard as well.
